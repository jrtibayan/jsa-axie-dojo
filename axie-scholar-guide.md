# Scholars Handbook
## A Players Guide to Axie Infinity
### How do I log into the game?
You will need a QR code in order to log into the game.  
This should be provided to you by the manager.  
Some manager give out the email address and password for the account so you can get the QR code yourself.
A more detailed tutorial will be added for this later.

### I have logged in, why is there no Axie on my home screen just like most scholars show on their screenshots?
Every scholar is given 3 Axies to fight with which should already be located in your Ronin Wallet.  
In-game click AXIES and you will see there is no Axie present.  
Clicking sync will sync your game and now will display the Axies that are in your Ronin Wallet.  
For it to be displayed on your home screen you will have to form a team.  
Click TEAMS and create a new team using your 3 Axies, name the team and save it.  
Your team should now be displayed on your home screen.
  
If you are not a scholar you will have to buy them from the market or P2P.  
I recommend the market as it is much safer.  
  
When you have your Axies
|  Goal | Name |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | Your Number1 goal is to make your daily grind easier. The further you can get on adventure the faster you can finish the daily 100 SLP from adventure. Use all your energy for adventure till you can easily do ruin10 or ruin15. When you run out of energy, you can now do arena to get 5 wins and get the daily quest. |
| 2  | When you can easily do ruin 10 or 15 to get 100 SLP from adventure you can now allocate a few energy for adventure and the rest will go to arena. This will help you gain extra SLP aside from the 150 you used to get before. |
| 3  | When you maxed your level on adventure you will be able to put 100% of your energy on arena. Make sure to practice a lot when you have no more energy so that you will improve faster and have better chance of winning when you play using energy.  |
