# JSA Axie Dojo Scholar List



## Scholars Quota
Good day scholars. Each scholar started on different day so for now we will be giving each scholar a different target SLP to be claimed by each scholar on the given claiming date. This target is computed as shown below.  
  
Scholar Target SLP = [Current SLP to be Claimed] + ( 150 SLP x [Days from starting date to end date] )  
  
Please see table below to check your target SLP to be claimed
