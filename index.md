# Welcome to JSA Axie Dojo
The first business venture built by Jeshan Capital to help people who are in need of extra income this time of pandemic.

## What is JSA Axie Dojo
JSA Axie Dojo was built to help people who want to play Axie Infinity but cannot afford to do so. It has a scholarship program that is designed to rapidly expand so that more and more Filipinos will be able to supplement their income by means of playing Axie Infinity.

## How do you earn money from Axie Infinity?
Axie Infinity is a play-to-earn game. It is a game which utilizes blockchain technology, the same technology that bitcoin uses. By playing this game, everytime a player finishes an adventure or wins an arena match the player is rewarded with SLP, a cryptocurrency which an be sold on an exchange like Binance and be deposited to your bank account, coinsph wallet, etc.

## How much can you earn by playing this game?
As the time of writing this section, June 29, 2021, the exchange rate is 1 SLP = PHP6.62.  
Everyday you can earn 100 SLP from ADVENTURE and 50 from DAILY QUEST.  
So you easily get 150 SLP everyday.  
Additional SLP may be earned by winning on the arena.

150 SLP x PHP 6.62 = PHP 993 daily  
PHP 993 x 30 days = PHP 29,000 monthly  
Total Earning = PHP 29,000 + (earned SLP on Arena x PHP 6.62)

This all depends of course on the exchange rate when you sell your SLP

## What is an Axie Infinity Scholarship?
In order for player to start earning on Axie Infinity, he/she will need 3 Axie, a pokemon like monster which is needed to fight on Adventure or the Arena. The cheapest Axie right now cost more than 100 USD and you need 3 of these which is why most poeple will shy away from this opportunity especially those who are not familiar with cryptocurrencies.  
The purpose of the scholarship is to fund these people. We invest our money and they will be able to play and earn through Axie Infinity. A small portion of the earned SLP will of course go to the scholarship program to fund more players and help more Filipinos.

## How much is given to the scholar?
60% will be given to the scholar  
10% will go to investor / Axie Dojo  
30% will go to the scholarship fund for new scholars  
(We are also looking into funding a pool to be used as prize on tournaments for the scholars)

## When is the earned SLP claimed?
The game lets you claim 15 days after the last time you claimed your SLP.  
But for JSA Axie Dojo we schedule the date and time the earned SLP will be claimed.

## Quota for the Scholars
Each sholar is expected to earn at least 150 SLP per day.
The quota would be calculated as seen below:  
  
Quota = [No. of days from last claim to next claim] x 150

## Scholarship Terms and Conditions
Each scholar is expected to follow the terms and conditions set by JSA Axie Dojo.
