# Welcome to JSA Axie Dojo
The first business venture built by Jeshan Capital to help people who are in need of extra income this time of pandemic.

## What is JSA Axie Dojo
JSA Axie Dojo was built to help people who want to play Axie Infinity but cannot afford to do so. It has a scholarship program that is designed to rapidly expand so that more and more Filipinos will be able to supplement their income by means of playing Axie Infinity.

## How do you earn money from Axie Infinity?
Axie Infinity is a play-to-earn game. It is a game which utilizes blockchain technology, the same technology that bitcoin uses. By playing this game, everytime a player finishes an adventure or wins an arena match the player is rewarded with SLP, a cryptocurrency which an be sold on an exchange like Binance and be deposited to your bank account, coinsph wallet, etc.

## How much can you earn by playing this game?
As the time of writing this section, June 29, 2021, the exchange rate is 1 SLP = PHP6.62.  
Everyday you can earn 100 SLP from ADVENTURE and 50 from DAILY QUEST.  
So you easily get 150 SLP everyday.  
Additional SLP may be earned by winning on the arena.

150 SLP x PHP 6.62 = PHP 993 daily  
PHP 993 x 30 days = PHP 29,000 monthly  
Total Earning = PHP 29,000 + (earned SLP on Arena x PHP 6.62)

This all depends of course on the exchange rate when you sell your SLP

## What is an Axie Infinity Scholarship?
In order for player to start earning on Axie Infinity, he/she will need 3 Axie, a pokemon like monster which is needed to fight on Adventure or the Arena. The cheapest Axie right now cost more than 100 USD and you need 3 of these which is why most poeple will shy away from this opportunity especially those who are not familiar with cryptocurrencies.  
The purpose of the scholarship is to fund these people. We invest our money and they will be able to play and earn through Axie Infinity. A small portion of the earned SLP will of course go to the scholarship program to fund more players and help more Filipinos.

## How much is given to the scholar?
60% will be given to the scholar  
10% will go to investor / Axie Dojo  
30% will go to the scholarship fund for new scholars  
(We are also looking into funding a pool to be used as prize on tournaments for the scholars)
  
## Guide for New Scholars
### What to do with your energy
|  Goal | Name |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | Your Number1 goal is to make your daily grind easier. The further you can get on adventure the faster you can finish the daily 100 SLP from adventure. Use all your energy for adventure till you can easily do ruin10 or ruin15. When you run out of energy, you can now do arena to get 5 wins and get the daily quest. |
| 2  | When you can easily do ruin 10 or 15 to get 100 SLP from adventure you can now allocate a few energy for adventure and the rest will go to arena. This will help you gain extra SLP aside from the 150 you used to get before. |
| 3  | When you maxed your level on adventure you will be able to put 100% of your energy on arena. Make sure to practice a lot when you have no more energy so that you will improve faster and have better chance of winning when you play using energy.  |
